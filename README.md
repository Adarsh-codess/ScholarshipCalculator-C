# Scholarship Calculator (C Program)

A simple C program that calculates scholarship amounts based on **gender** and **score**.

---

## 👨‍💻 Features

- Takes user input for **name**, **gender**, and **score**  
- Uses **string handling** functions (`toupper`, `tolower`, `strcmp`)  
- Implements **conditional logic** to calculate scholarship  
- Outputs results in a **user-friendly format**  
- Basic **input validation**  
- Designed with **modularity** in mind for future enhancements

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Learned

- **C Programming** (variables, input/output, conditionals, loops)  
- **String Manipulation**  
- **Function Logic & Modularity**  
- **Basic Embedded System Thinking** (input validation, branching logic)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-codess/ScholarshipCalculator-C.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd ScholarshipCalculator-C
3. Compile the program using GCC:
gcc scholarship.c -o scholarship
4. Run the program:
./scholarship # On Windows use scholarship.exe

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Add loops for multiple calculations  
- Handle invalid inputs more gracefully  
- Convert into a GUI-based program  
- Expand for file input/output  
- Practice integrating into embedded system simulation

---

## 📈 Purpose
This project is a **learning and practice project** for improving C programming, problem-solving, and logic skills — foundational skills for **AUTOSAR & embedded systems development**.
